# LogitechLCDFFXI
A FFXI applet for the Logitech GamePanel  
  
A work-in-progress.  
Final goal is to create an application that connects to a Windower4 LUA script to show information from FFXI on the Logitech GamePanel.  
  
Only monochrome support is currently planned, but colour LCD may come in the future.
